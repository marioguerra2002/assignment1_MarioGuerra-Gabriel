# assignment1_MarioGuerra-GabrielFranco
This is the first assignment of the subject “Algorithm and Advanced Structure Data”. 
To compile the different experiments, you’ll have to enter into each package and write: \n
	javac experient_name.java 
And next, to run it you need to write:
	java experiment_name_compiled
Name of the experiments:
	First exercise: you have to change in line 65 the number of the integer used to build the QUnionFind object. Also, in the loop of line 63, you can change the values to modify how many unions can be done and how many every iteration.
	Second exercise: it works the same way that previous exercise. For loop line 60 and for building, line 62.
	Fifth exercise: you have to change the integer you give to the object with the goal of generating a range of numbers between the given number in positive and negative, in line 53. 
	Sixth exercise: it works the same way that previous exercise. For change, this value is in line 53.
	Eighth exercise: you have to change the integer that determines the matrix size, in line 63; and on line 80, the number of iterations that you want to execute in order to get an average time.
